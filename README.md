# Moshiach770Brachahs

1) Instructions for Writing
When writing to the Rebbe King Moshiach Shlita include your Jewish
Name and Mother's name (a non-Jew writes their father's name) and
likewise for all those you are requesting a blessing for (family name
is not necessary). Good news is also something to write to the Rebbe
King Moshiach Shlita and good resolutions to add in Torah and Mitzvos
(especially Torah study about Moshiach and Tzedakah donations) which
will add in receiving the blessing. Mainly accept the kingship of
Moshiach by writing "Long live the Rebbe King Moshiach forever" to his
majesty. The best is to visit the Rebbe King Moshiach shlita in person
in 770 Eastern pkwy Brooklyn, New York at Sunday dollars etc. If this
is not possible this app will get the letter to Moshiach.

Miraculous Blessings
An example of a Miracle through a blessing of the Rebbe King Moshiach Shlita:
In 5770 (2010), A. severely injured his leg in an accident. He had an
operation which was supposed to improve his condition, but it was
unsuccessful. It was hard for him to walk, and he had constant,
intense pain. His friend, a Chabad rabbi, offered to write to the
Rebbe King Moshiach Shlita, requesting a blessing for his complete
recovery. By Divine providence he came across a letter of the Rebbe
King Moshiach Shlita which says that a Jew should never feel down, and
ends by blessing him with numerous blessings. A few months later, the
rabbi told A. that he was traveling to Brooklyn to see the Rebbe King
Moshiach Shlita and could request a blessing from the Rebbe King
Moshiach Shlita in person at dollars. A. told him to tell the Rebbe
King Moshiach Shlita that if his leg would be healed, he would become
a completely observant Jew. When the rabbi went to receive a dollar
and blessing from the Rebbe King Moshiach Shlita, he requested a
blessing for A. and added that A. had said that he would become
completely observant if he would recover.
The rabbi returned from his trip. A while later A. told the rabbi
that his situation was not improving. Later that day, the rabbi came
across a holy letter of the Rebbe King Moshiach Shlita. It spoke about
the fact that a Jew’s physical success is intricately connected with
his performance of the Commandments. The letter goes on to say that
just like it isn’t enough to believe that it is important to eat – one
must actually eat in order to gain strength, so too it is not enough
to believe in G–d and His Commandments – a Jew must actually perform
the Commandments, and only then will things go well for him. At the
end of the letter, the Rebbe King Moshiach Shlita guarantees that his
physical matters will be successful if he will keep the Commandments,
and is awaiting good news. As a result of this letter, A. began to
strengthen his performance of the Commandments, including praying,
putting on Tefillin and studying Torah regularly.
A short while later, A.’s doctors decided to try the previously
unsuccessful operation again. Because of A.’s efforts in performing
the Commandments, this time the operation was completely successful!
A. now walks normally and you cannot even tell that he ever had an
accident!
